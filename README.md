# Brendan Kinder

- I like playing video games, mainly rhythm games and rpgs. Xenoblade Chronicles 2 being my favorite game.
- When reading I prefer visual and light novels. Favorite visual novel would be AI: The Somnium Files.
- I mainly listen to rock and metal music, Dance Gavin Dance being my favorite band.

## Technical Background

All of my programming experience comes from the Java and Python I have learned taking CIS classes at GVSU. I have technical experience mainly in Windows, mainly because of my personal computer, but I do have some experience in Linux.
